# What is this repo for?

This is a project I've built for my personal website. It enables people to take a look at some code I've written and will help people be able to give me tips on how to improve.

### Which tech have I used to build it?

It's build with `JavaScript` using the `ReactJS` framework.

It's repo is hosted on `GitHub` (where I think you'll be reading this).

The site itself is hosted with `Netlify` and can be seen live [here](https://www.quartersight.co.uk).
